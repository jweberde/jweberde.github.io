          People keep asking me: Why did you study Information System and not Computer Science. The answer is simple I love to see things in context. I was never only interested in one small component of a large applications.
          I wanted to be able to understand the whole thing.

          After talking to Head of Development, CTO's and CIO's during my internships, I was able to find my path. When I started university I already had a lot of development experience, which helped me a lot.
